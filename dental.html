        <h2><b>Tooth Decay:</b></h2>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
Tooth decay, also known as dental caries or cavities, is a common dental problem that occurs when bacteria in the mouth produce acids that erode the enamel of the teeth. If left untreated, it can lead to pain, infection, and tooth loss.<br>
<h3>Causes:</h3><br>

<b>Poor Oral Hygiene:</b> Inadequate brushing and flossing can allow plaque to build up, leading to decay.<br>
<b>Diet:</b> Consuming sugary and acidic foods and beverages contributes to the formation of acids that can harm teeth.<br>
<b>Dry Mouth:</b> Lack of saliva increases the risk of tooth decay as saliva helps neutralize acids and prevent plaque buildup.<br>
<b>Lack of Fluoride:</b> Fluoride helps strengthen tooth enamel. Insufficient fluoride can make teeth more susceptible to decay.<br>
<h3><b>Symptoms:</b></h3>

<b>Toothache</b> Persistent or throbbing pain in the affected tooth.<br>
<b>Sensitivity</b>: Increased sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet foods and drinks.<br>
<b>Visible Holes or Pits</b>: Dark spots or visible holes on the surface of the tooth.<br>
<b>Pain when Chewing:</b> Discomfort or pain while eating.<br>

<h3><b>Prevention:</b></h3>

<b>Regular Brushing and Flossing:</b> Brush teeth at least twice a day and floss once a day to remove plaque.<br>
    <b>Balanced Diet:</b> Limit sugary and acidic foods. Consume a diet rich in calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth<br>.
        <b>Fluoride:</b> Use fluoride toothpaste, and consider fluoride treatments if recommended by your dentist.<br>
            <b>Regular Dental Check-ups:</b> Visit your dentist for regular check-ups and professional cleanings.<br>
<h3><b>Treatment:</b></h3>

<b>Fillings:</b> For small to moderate cavities, dentists can remove the decayed portion and fill the space with dental materials.
<b>Crowns:</b> For larger cavities, a dental crown may be necessary to restore the tooth's structure.
<b>Root Canal:</b> If the decay reaches the pulp of the tooth, a root canal may be required to remove the infected tissue.
<b>Tooth Extraction:</b> In severe cases, when a tooth cannot be saved, extraction may be necessary.
